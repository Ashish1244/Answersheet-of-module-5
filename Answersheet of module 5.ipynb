    "# 1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).\n",
    "  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software around objects, which are data structures that contain both data (attributes) and the functions (methods) that operate on that data. These objects are created from blueprints called classes, which define their properties and behaviors. OOP uses core principles like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction to build modular, reusable, and maintainable code, making it ideal for large-scale projects"
